    "A checkpoint in gem5-X captures the entire state of the simulated system at a specific point in time, including the register values, memory contents, cache state, and microarchitectural details. It allows users to save the state of a running simulation and later restore it to continue execution from the exact same point. This is particularly useful for debugging, performance analysis, and experimentation purposes.\n",
